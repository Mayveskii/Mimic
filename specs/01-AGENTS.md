# AGENTS.md — Mimic

## What This Is

Mimic is a standalone MCP server with a C-core. It is an **optional tool** that any AI-agent can call — the same way it calls bash, grep, or any other MCP tool. The agent is fully autonomous and works without Mimic. When the agent chooses to call Mimic, it gets help packaging an intent into a validated OpPacket chain — backed by distilled patterns from production code and behaviors borrowed from proven implementations.

Mimic supports both short coding tasks and long-running scientific research. Context is retained without loss via RAG, session snapshots, and mesh memory.

## Rules

1. No action without user permission
2. Facts only — nothing invented
3. Semantics before code — no function without a row in SEMANTICS.md
4. No file edits without permission
5. Every non-trivial decision = ADR

## Reading the Project

### For agents contributing to Mimic:

1. Read `specs-v2/README.md` — what Mimic IS
2. Read `specs-v2/STRUCTURE.md` — how to navigate
3. Choose domain → read `specs-v2/domains/<name>/PROCESS.md`
4. Read `specs-v2/invariants/META_INVARIANT.md` — root rule
5. Read old specs (00-10) for historical context ONLY
6. Read `mimicrya/behavior-sources.yaml` — where behaviors come from

## Two Sources of Knowledge

### Distillation (mimicrya/repos-manifest.yaml)
Production repos (etcd, k8s, go-ethereum, terraform, autogen, crewai, and 90+ others) → git blame → survival index → best commits → mesh slots. These are proven patterns that survived in real systems. All repos tracked; analysis is ongoing.

### Mimicry (mimicrya/behavior-sources.yaml)
Mayveskii/* repos (bun, exa-mcp-server, gh-aw-mcpg, code-mode, opencode, hermes-agent, vllm, gastown, openmythos, and others) → behavior selection: HOW to implement a function in Mimic. Bun showed how to orchestrate phases → Mimic implements a phase graph. gh-aw-mcpg showed how to route MCP → Mimic implements transport. This is not copying — it's selecting the best behavior to implement.

## Commands

```bash
make              # Build libcore.a + mimic binary
make lint         # Check code (go vet + gofmt)
make check        # lint + test + semantics-check
make distill      # Run distillation pipeline
make release      # Build binaries + checksums
docker build .    # Build container image
```

## Branches

- `main` — stable releases only (tags)
- `dev` — C-core development, specs, and canonical specifications
- `embryo` — Go implementations (pkg/, internal/, cmd/), documentation, tools, tests
- Feature branches: `feat/*` → PR → squash merge to dev → squash merge to main on release tag

## Key Concepts

- **OpPacket chain** — ordered sequence of deterministic operations, validated BEFORE execution
- **Conflict matrix** — [OP_MAX × OP_MAX] matrix defining which operations cannot run together
- **Energy cost matrix** — [OP_MAX × 3] matrix: cost_tokens, cost_time_us, cost_memory_bytes
- **Z-density** — density of proven knowledge in a mesh slot
- **Survival index** — fraction of commit lines still present at HEAD (git blame → metric)
- **Mimicry** — selecting behavior from best implementations in Mayveskii/* repos
- **Distillation** — git blame → survival → extract → bmap slot → Z-density
- **6-phase pipeline** — CLASSIFY → PLAN → VALIDATE → EXEC → VERIFY → RESPOND
- **Meta-invariant** — no_side_effect_without_prior_validation (root cause of all 30 APs)
- **Research mode** — long-running sessions with checkpoint/resume, large context, and self-management
- **mimic-server** — FUTURE: shared knowledge hub for multiple clients. Not part of current scope.

## Notes

- All specs in specs-v2 are in English. Zero Russian in specs.
- Every line in specs-v2 follows: behavior → result → why
- No "implemented/pending/done" in spec text. Only desired behavior.
- libbmap.a sources exist in `/home/cisco/findings/fck_sleep/binary-mesh/c-core/`
- Semantics check script does not exist yet: `make semantics-check` is stubbed
- Old specs (00-11) describe historical design; canonical specs moved to specs-v2/
